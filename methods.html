                <h3>Device Selection and Specifications</h3>
                <p>We analyzed three types of computing devices—desktops, laptops, and servers—each chosen for its significance in common usage scenarios. The desktop represents standard office setups, the laptop covers portable, energy-efficient devices, and the server highlights data-intensive applications in enterprise environments. Testing devices with comparable specifications allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about energy efficiency across different setups.</p>

                <h3>Operating Conditions Tested</h3>
                <p>Each device was assessed under four main operating conditions: idle (powered on with no active applications), low load (light tasks like browsing), high load (intensive tasks like gaming), and power-saving mode (sleep or low-power state). Testing these conditions gives us insights into how each state affects energy consumption, revealing patterns of high and low energy demand that are crucial for effective power management.</p>

                <h3>Experimental Design</h3>
                <p>We conducted the tests in a controlled environment, maintaining a consistent room temperature to prevent fluctuations in energy data. Each device was tested for 30 minutes to 1 hour per condition, and power consumption was recorded every minute. This systematic approach ensures reliable and comparable results across devices and conditions.</p>

                <h3>Proposed Efficiency Methods</h3>
                <p>We tested several methods for reducing energy consumption, including lowering screen brightness on laptops, activating low-power modes, and limiting server CPU performance to 70%. These methods proved effective in reducing power usage, with minimal impact on device performance. These efficiency strategies, when implemented broadly, can lead to significant reductions in overall energy consumption.</p>
