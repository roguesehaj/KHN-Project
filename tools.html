            <h3>1. Digital Power Meter</h3>
            <img src="https://how2electronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IoT-Electricity-Energy-Meter.jpg" alt="" class="case-study-image">
            <p>The digital power meter is a hardware tool used to measure the real-time power consumption of devices by recording their watt usage across different states (idle, low load, and high load). This device provides precise readings by capturing the power drawn by each device every second, helping us identify peak energy usage and potential areas for improvement. The digital power meter is especially useful in gauging overall consumption and tracking variations in power use under different operating conditions.</p>

            <p>The clamp meter is used to measure the current flow, allowing for component-level power analysis. By clamping onto the power supply line, this tool provides insights into power usage by individual components, such as processors or cooling fans. The clamp meter is invaluable for understanding how specific parts contribute to the total power consumption of a device.</p>
