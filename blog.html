            <h3>2. How Devices Consume Power: A Deep Dive</h3>
            <p>Understanding how computing devices consume power is essential for identifying areas for improvement. Here’s a quick breakdown: 
                <br> <br>
                <ul class="article2">
                <li><b>Desktops:</b> Generally consume the most energy among personal devices due to their powerful processors, cooling fans, and continuous power supply. Desktop computers often remain in active or idle states, which increases their overall consumption.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Laptops:</b> While designed to be more energy-efficient, laptops still consume significant power, especially when handling tasks like video editing or gaming. Their power usage can be optimized through power-saving modes and efficient battery management.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Servers:</b> Servers, especially in data centers, are built for high-demand processing, leading to continuous energy consumption. They require constant cooling and tend to run even when idle to ensure maximum uptime, making them major energy consumers in the tech industry.</li>
                <br>
                </ul>

            <h3>3. Practical Tips for Reducing Power Consumption</h3>
            <p>Energy-saving practices can make a difference in day-to-day device use. Here are practical, actionable steps for improving energy efficiency in desktops, laptops, and servers:
                <br> <br>
                <ul class="article2">
                <li><b> Screen Brightness:</b> Reducing screen brightness by even 30% can make a noticeable impact on power consumption, especially on laptops and desktops. Using “auto-brightness” settings can help maintain optimal brightness levels based on lighting conditions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b> Low-Power Mode:</b> Most devices come with built-in low-power settings, like “Battery Saver” on Windows and “Low Power Mode” on macOS. These features limit background activity, reduce performance slightly, and extend battery life without affecting essential tasks.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Optimize Processor Performance:</b> High processor performance is necessary only for demanding tasks. Limiting CPU speed or setting a power plan for “balanced” performance can keep energy use under control without sacrificing speed for daily tasks.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Utilize Hibernate and Sleep Modes:</b> Idle devices still consume energy. Instead of leaving a device on, enabling “Sleep” or “Hibernate” modes during breaks or after-hours can save energy. Sleep mode is suitable for short breaks, while hibernate mode can save more energy during longer inactivity.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b> Down Unused Devices:</b> For data centers or offices, powering down or disconnecting unused servers and desktops can save substantial energy. Scheduling downtime for non-essential equipment ensures that resources are only used when needed.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>
